= Paginate

Paginate collections using SIZE+1 to determine if there is a next page. Includes ActiveRecord and ActionView support.

Works only with <b>Rails 3+</b>.

== Install

  gem install paginate

== Usage

You can use Paginate with or without ActiveRecord. Let's try a simple array pagination. Imagine that you have something like this in your controller.

  @things = Array.new(11) {|i| "Item #{i}"}

Then on your view:

  <%= paginate @things %>

That's it! This is all you have to do! In this case we're using the default page size (which is 10).
The url used on page links is taken from the current requested uri.

You can set default values globally:

  Paginate.configure do |config|
    config.size = 20
    config.param_name = :p
  end

More examples:

  Post.paginate(1)                               # page 1 from Post model
  Post.paginate(:page => 1)                      # page 1 from Post model
  Post.paginate(:page => 1, :size => 5)          # page 1 from Post model with custom size
  @user.things.paginate(:page => params[:page])  # paginate association

  <%= paginate @things, :size => 5 %>
  <%= paginate @things, :url => proc {|page| things_path(:page => page) } %>
  <%= paginate @things, "/some/path" %>
  <%= paginate @things, :param_name => :p %>

To render the collection, you must use the <tt>render</tt> helper, providing the <tt>:paginate => true</tt> option. This is required cause we're always considering SIZE + 1, so if you use the regular +each+ or don't pass this option, you end up rendering one additional item.

  <%= render @things, :paginate => true %>
  <%= render @things, :paginate => true, :size => 5 %>
  <%= render "thing", :collection => @things, :paginate => true, :size => 5 %>

== I18n support

If you want to translate links, you have implement the following scopes:

  en:
    paginate:
      next: "Older"
      previous: "Newer"
      page: "Page {{page}}"
      more: "Load more"

== Styling

If you want something like Twitter Search use this CSS:

  .paginate { overflow: hidden; }
  .paginate li { float: left; }
  .paginate li.previous-page:after { content: "«"; padding: 0 5px; }
  .paginate li.next-page:before { content: "»"; padding: 0 5px; }
  .paginate .disabled { display: none; }
